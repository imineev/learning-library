# Welcome to the OCI Basics Workshop

This lab series will present a fast and simple overview of basic OCI services to familiarize the learner with core OCI services.   After you complete this lab you will be able to launch a simple cloud instance suitable for single use development.  You'll create a VCN, launch a pre-configured developer instance, and attach block storage to store a simple application.   Then you'll delete the instance and start over, transferring the boot and block volumes in the process. 

**Note:** *SSH Keys are a critical component for access to most of the Oracle labs.  We've included a short lab section that outlines how to create SSH keys on the three major desktop systems.  Please utilize the SSH Key lab if you are unfamiliar with creating and utilizing SSH keys for secure, remote system access.*
