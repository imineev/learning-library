# Lab 100: Load and Access Data

## Before You Begin
### Objectives

- Download data pump export file.
- Upload data pump export file to the object store bucket.
- Generate an auth token.
- Setup a SQL Developer connection to your Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) Database.
- Create a DBMS_CLOUD credential.
- Import Data into the Autonomous Transaction Processing Database.
- Create an external table.

### Introduction

Derek is a Python developer, and so he avoids spending time in secondary tasks such as database-related work. However, some database work is unavoidable. It’s necessary to secure the database with authorization token files. It’s necessary to create database users. And it’s necessary to load application data. The Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Database Cloud Service reduces database-related work to a bare minimum.  In Lab 100 you will first create an Object Store Bucket to provide accessible file storage within the Compartment containing the Autonomous Transaction Processing Database. You will then secure database access by creating authorization tokens and distributing the related wallet file. You will also create necessary database users and necessary database objects. Then you will import necessary application data from a remote export file into the Autonomous Transaction Processing Database. As a final task you will create an external table (accessible via the Autonomous Transansaction Processing Database) containing customer credit score data.


<!-- **Please Note:** Steps 1-3 are done locally. Steps 4 and on are done on your Oracle Cloud Developer Image Instance. -->

**Please Note:** All steps are done on your Oracle Cloud Developer Image Instance.


## **STEP 1:** Log in to your OCI dashboard and switch regions

- Open firefox from inside the image (you should still be in the image from the previous lab) and [login](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) to your cloud account.

  ![](images/100/016.png " ")

- Click **select files**, then select the `expdp_alpha.dmp` and the `credit_scoring_100k_pq`. Note we will be importing data from the `expdp_alpha.dmp` file, and later querying data from the `credit_scoring_100k_pq` (big data parquet file). The latter file will be used in a future lab. This is just showing you how easy it is to query parquet (and avro) files. Click `Open`, then `Upload Objects`.

  ![](images/100/058.png " ")

- Connect to user alpha.

  ![](images/100/059.png " ")

- Confirm the data has been imported by expending the connection and the tables.

  ![](images/100/060.png " ")

- Create spatial metadata for use in lab 300 and lab 400.  Enter the following in the SQL Developer Worksheet:

`insert into user_sdo_geom_metadata select * from sdo_geom_metadata;`
`commit;`

  ![](images/100/065.png " ")


## **STEP 11:** Create external table 

- Repeat Step 8 from above in this new user, and execute the following SQL Statements to create the DBMS_CLOUD Credential `py4dev_cred`.
```
begin
  DBMS_CLOUD.create_credential(
  credential_name => 'py4dev_cred',
  username => '<your cloud userid>',
  password => '<Auth Token Generated in STEP 4>'
  );
end;
/
```
- Obtain the URI of the `credit_scoring_100k_pq` file from object storage in your console.

  ![](images/100/061.png " ")

- Copy the URI path into SQL Developer (temporarily)

  ![](images/100/062.png " ")

- Copy the following code into SQL Developer below the above URI, and then replace with the uri from above and execute.

```
begin
    dbms_cloud.create_external_table (
       table_name =>'credit_scoring_100k_ext',
       credential_name =>'py4dev_cred',
       file_uri_list =>'https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/idyofk9mgrls/b/py4dev/o/credit_scoring_100k_pq',
       format =>  '{"type":"parquet",  "schema": "first"}'
    );
end;
/
```
- SQL Dev:

  ![](images/100/063.png " ")
